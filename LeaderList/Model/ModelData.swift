Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and Biden was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\n\nTaking office at age 78, Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history, the first to have a female vice president, and the first from Delaware. In 2021, he signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill, as well as a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. Biden proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law in 2022. Biden also signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which focused on manufacturing. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to prevent a first ever national default by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control.

After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at the hedge fund firms The Children's Investment Fund Management and Theleme Partners.\n\n Sunak was elected to the House of Commons for Richmond in North Yorkshire at the 2015 general election. As a backbencher, Sunak supported the successful campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum. Following the 2017 general election, Sunak was appointed to a junior ministerial position in Theresa May's second government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Local Government in the 2018 cabinet reshuffle. He voted three times in favour of May's Brexit withdrawal agreement, which was rejected by Parliament three times, leading to May announcing her resignation. During the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, Sunak supported Johnson's successful bid to succeed May as Conservative leader and prime minister, after which he appointed Sunak as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July 2019.\n\nFollowing the 2019 general election, Johnson promoted Sunak to Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 2020 cabinet reshuffle after the resignation of Sajid Javid. During his time in the position, Sunak was prominent in the government's financial response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, including the Coronavirus Job Retention and Eat Out to Help Out schemes. He was also involved in the government's response to the cost of living crisis, UK energy supply crisis, and global energy crisis. Sunak resigned as chancellor in July 2022 amid a government crisis that culminated in Johnson's resignation.\n\nSunak stood in the July‚ÄìSeptember Conservative Party leadership election to succeed Johnson. He had received the most votes in each of the series of MP votes, but lost the members' vote to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

Born in Buenos Aires, Fern√°ndez attended the University of Buenos Aires, where he earned his law degree at the age of 24, and later became a professor of criminal law.A member of the Peronist Justicialist Party, Fern√°ndez was the party's candidate for the 2019 Argentine general election and defeated incumbent president Mauricio Macri, with 48% of the votes. His political position has been described as left-wing.\n\nThe first two years of his presidency was limited by the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina, during which he imposed strict lockdown measures to suppress the spread of the disease, and a debt crisis inherited from his predecessor. While the economy did recover in 2021‚Äì22, inflation rose to 100% (the highest since 1991). His approval ratings have been constantly low throughout his presidency, only in few certain occasions over 50% approval rate, with disapproval ratings from 60% to 80%.\n\nAccording to British newspaper The Economist, he is considered 'a president without a plan', and his presidency to be a 'weak administration', alluding to his lack of independent decision-making. Instead, his decisions are under heavy influence of Vice President and former President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, also leader of the coalition, whom Fern√°ndez himself described as a permanent source of consultation.'\n\nIn April 2023, Fern√°ndez announced that he decided to not seek reelection to the presidency in the 2023 general election.\n\n", imageName: "alberto-fernandez", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: -34.608204  ,longitude: -58.370243)),
    
    Leader(name: "Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador", age: 69, DOB: "13/11/1953", country: "Mexico", position: "President", flag: "üá≤üáΩ", description: "Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, also known by his initials AMLO, is a Mexican politician who has been serving as the 65th president of Mexico since 1 December 2018. He previously served as Head of Government of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005. \n\nBorn in Tepetit√°n, in the municipality of Macuspana, in the south-eastern state of Tabasco, L√≥pez Obrador earned a degree in political science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico following a hiatus from his studies to participate in politics. He began his political career in 1976 as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). His first public position was as director of the Indigenous Institute of Tabasco, where he promoted the addition of books in indigenous languages and the project of the Chontal ridge. In 1989, he joined the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), becoming the party's 1994 candidate for Governor of Tabasco, and national leader between 1996 and 1999. In 2000, he was elected Head of Government of Mexico City. During his tenure, his policies on crime, infrastructure and social spending made him a popular figure on the Mexican left. In 2004, his state immunity from prosecution was removed after refusing to cease construction on land allegedly expropriated by his predecessor, Rosario Robles. This legal process lasted for a year and ended with L√≥pez Obrador maintaining his right to run for office.\n\nL√≥pez Obrador was nominated as the presidential candidate for the Coalition for the Good of All during the 2006 elections, where he was narrowly defeated by the National Action Party (PAN) candidate Felipe Calder√≥n. While the Federal Electoral Tribunal noted a number of irregularities, it denied L√≥pez Obrador's request for a general recount, which sparked protests across the country. In 2011 he founded Morena, a civil association and later political party. He was a candidate for the Progressive Movement coalition in the 2012 elections, won by the Commitment to Mexico coalition candidate Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. In 2012, he left the PRD after protesting the party's signing of the Pact for Mexico and joined Morena. As part of the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition, L√≥pez Obrador was elected president after a landslide victory in the 2018 general election.\n\nOften described as a center-left, progressive, populist, and economic nationalist, L√≥pez Obrador has been a national politician for over three decades. During his presidency, he has promoted public investment in sectors that had been liberalized under previous administrations and has implemented a number of progressive social reforms. Supporters have praised him for promoting institutional renewal after decades of high inequality and corruption, and refocusing the country's neoliberal consensus towards improving the state of the working class. Critics have claimed that his administration has stumbled in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and attempts to deal with drug cartels has antagonized Mexican democratic institutions and that the economy had already faltered before the pandemic.\n\n", imageName: "andres-manuel", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 19.432590,  longitude: -99.131860)),

    Leader(name: "Anthony Albanese", age: 60, DOB: "02/03/1963", country: "Australia", position: "Prime Minister", flag: "üá¶üá∫", description: "Anthony Norman Albanese is an Australian politician serving as the 31st and current prime minister of Australia since 2022. He has been leader of the Australian Labor Party since 2019 and the member of parliament for Grayndler since 1996. \n\nAlbanese was born in Sydney to an Italian father and an Irish-Australian mother who raised him as a single parent. He attended St Mary's Cathedral College before going on to the University of Sydney to study economics. He joined the Labor Party as a student, and before entering Parliament worked as a party official and research officer. Albanese was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1996 election, winning the seat of Grayndler in New South Wales. He was first appointed to the shadow cabinet in 2001 by Simon Crean and went on to serve in a number of roles, eventually becoming Manager of Opposition Business in 2006. After Labor's victory in the 2007 election, Albanese was appointed Leader of the House, and was also made Minister for Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. In the subsequent leadership tensions between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard from 2010 to 2013, Albanese was publicly critical of the conduct of both, calling for party unity. After supporting Rudd in the final leadership ballot between the two in June 2013, Albanese was elected the deputy leader of the Labor Party and sworn in as deputy prime minister the following day, a position he held for less than three months, as Labor was defeated at the 2013 election. \n\nAfter Rudd resigned the leadership and retired from politics, Albanese stood against Bill Shorten in the ensuing leadership election, the first to include party members in addition to MPs. Although Albanese won a large majority of the membership, Shorten won more heavily among Labor MPs and won the contest; Shorten subsequently appointed Albanese to his Shadow Cabinet. After Labor's surprise defeat in the 2019 election, Shorten resigned as leader, with Albanese becoming the only person nominated in the leadership election to replace him; he was subsequently elected unopposed as leader of the Labor Party, becoming Leader of the Opposition. \n\nIn the 2022 election, Albanese led his party to a decisive victory against Scott Morrison's Liberal-National Coalition. Albanese is the first Italian-Australian to become prime minister, the first Australian prime minister to have a non-Anglo-Celtic surname, and is the last of the 16 Australian prime ministers who have served under Queen Elizabeth II. He was sworn in on 23 May 2022, alongside four senior frontbench colleagues. Albanese's first acts as prime minister included updating Australia's climate targets in an effort to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and supporting an increase to the national minimum wage. His government legislated a national anti-corruption commission, made major changes to Australian labour law and established the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme. In foreign policy, Albanese pledged further logistical support to Ukraine to assist with the Russo-Ukrainian war, has attempted to strengthen relations in the Pacific region, and held a high-level meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping, overseeing an easing of tensions between the countries and leading to easing of trade restrictions put by China on Australia. He also oversaw the official commencement of the AUKUS security pact between Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\n", imageName: "anthony_albanese", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: -35.308167,  longitude: 149.124510)),

He was elected secretary-general of the Socialist Party in 2014.\n\nCosta's first role in a Socialist government was as minister of parliamentary affairs under Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Guterres between 1997 and 1999. He was Minister of Justice from 1999 to 2002.Costa was a member of the European Parliament for the Socialist Party (PES), heading the list for the 2004 European elections after the dramatic death of top candidate Ant√≥nio de Sousa Franco. On 20 July 2004 he was elected as one of the 14 vice-presidents of the European Parliament. He also served on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. \n\nCosta resigned as an MEP on 11 March 2005 to become Minister of State and Internal Administration in the government of Jos√© S√≥crates following the 2005 national elections. Ant√≥nio Costa resigned all government offices in May 2007 to become his party's candidate for the municipality of Lisbon, Portugal's capital city. He was elected as Lisbon's mayor on 15 July 2007 and reelected in 2009 and 2013, with a bigger majority each time. In April 2015 he resigned his duties as a mayor, while he was already the secretary general of the Socialist Party and the party's candidate for Prime Minister, so that he could prepare his campaign for the October 2015 general elections.\n\nIn September 2014, the Socialist Party chose Costa as its candidate to be prime minister of Portugal in the 2015 national elections; in a ballot to select the party's candidate, gaining nearly 70 percent of the votes, he defeated party leader Ant√≥nio Jos√© Seguro, who announced his resignation after the result. By April 2015, he stepped down as mayor to focus on his campaign. \n\nDuring the campaign, Costa pledged to ease back on austerity and give more disposable income back to households. He proposed to boost incomes, hiring and growth in order to cut the budget deficits while scrapping austerity measures and cutting taxes for the middle and lower classes, asserting that would still allow deficits to reduce in line with the Euro convergence criteria. Also, he pledged to roll back a hugely unpopular hike in value added tax on restaurants and reinstate some benefits for civil servants.\n\n", imageName: "antonio_costa", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 38.712481,  longitude: -9.153670)),

He helped found the New Era Party in 2002, which in 2011 merged with others to form the Unity Party (renamed New Unity in 2018). After serving as a deputy in Latvia's parliament (the Saeima), as Minister of Economics, and also as a Member of the European Parliament throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Kari≈Ü≈° was selected by New Unity to be its prime ministerial candidate in the 2018 Latvian parliamentary election.

    Leader(name: "Chris Hipkins", age: 44, DOB: "05/09/1978", country: "New Zealand", position: "Prime Minister", flag: "üá≥üáø", description: "Christopher John Hipkins is a New Zealand politician who has been serving as the 41st prime minister of New Zealand and leader of the New Zealand Labour Party since 2023. He became member of Parliament for Remutaka in 2008.\n\nHipkins was born and raised in the Hutt Valley in Wellington, and while at Victoria University of Wellington became heavily involved in student politics. He was elected president of VUWSA twice, in 2000 and 2001. Hipkins won the pre-selection for the typically safe Labour seat of Remutaka in the Hutt Valley in 2008, but due to the return of the National Party to governance won it by a thin margin. As Labour's education spokesperson during their nine years in opposition, Hipkins became regarded as a 'cut-throat political player' and a sharp, quick-witted debater. \n\nAfter Jacinda Ardern led Labour to victory in the 2017 general election, Hipkins assumed multiple portfolios within the Sixth Labour Government, serving variously as minister of education, police, the public service, and leader of the House. For his perceived competence within multiple roles and responsibilities, Hipkins became regarded as Labour's 'fixer'. His tenure as minister of health was widely praised, and he was central to the government's highly effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. The elimination policy became the primary focus of the 2020 election, helping Labour win in a landslide. After the victory, Hipkins took on more responsibility, serving as minister for COVID-19 response from November 2020 to June 2022. On 21 January 2023, Hipkins became the sole candidate to succeed Jacinda Ardern as leader of the Labour Party after she announced her resignation. He became party leader after being elected unopposed on 22 January 2023, and was consequently appointed prime minister by the governor-general on 25 January 2023. He is expected to lead the Labour Party into the 2023 general election. His premiership was faced almost immediately with the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods, and then by further flooding from Cyclone Gabrielle.\n\nHipkins is often characterised ideologically as pragmatic. He has emphasised 'bread and butter' issues during his premiership, such as combatting the increased cost of living. Some observers see this is a push to retain or regain the support of the centrist swing voters who abandoned National in swathes for Labour in 2020. In July 2023, Labour introduced sweeping welfare initiatives as part of that year's budget, including a $1 billion Cyclone Recovery plan, a large increase in childcare and parental leave, scrapping prescription co-payments, free public transport for under-13s (and half price for under-25s), and increasing the funding for Te Matatini tenfold.\n\nHipkins is often regarded as affable and self-deprecating, and is commonly known by his nickname, Chippy, derived from his initials and his 'schoolboy demeanour'. Despite Labour's intense competition in opinion polls with National ahead of the upcoming general election, Hipkins remains broadly popular, and has consistently been placed comfortably ahead of rival Christopher Luxon in preferred prime minister rankings.\n\n", imageName: "chris_hipkins", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: -41.278396,  longitude: 174.776377)),

Ex officio, he is also one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra. Earlier, Macron served as the Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs under President Fran√ßois Hollande from 2014 to 2016 and Deputy Secretary-General to the President from 2012 to 2014.\n\nBorn in Amiens, he studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, later completing a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po and graduating from the √âcole nationale d'administration in 2004. Macron worked as a senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and later became an investment banker at Rothschild & Co.\n\nMacron was appointed √âlys√©e deputy secretary-general by President Fran√ßois Hollande shortly after his election in May 2012, making him one of Hollande's senior advisers. He was appointed to the Government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls as Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August of 2014. In this role, Macron championed a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August 2016, launching a campaign for the 2017 presidential election. Although Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of En Marche, a centrist and pro-European political movement he founded in April 2016.\n\nPartly thanks to the Fillon affair which sank The Republicans nominee Fran√ßois Fillon, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, before he was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen of the National Front. At the age of 39, Macron became the youngest president in French history. In the 2017 legislative election in June, Macron's party, renamed La R√©publique En Marche! (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. He appointed √âdouard Philippe as prime minister until his resignation in 2020, when he appointed Jean Castex. Macron was elected to a second term in the 2022 presidential election, again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French presidential candidate to win reelection since Jacques Chirac in 2002. However, in the 2022 legislative election, his centrist coalition lost its absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament and the formation of France's first minority government since the fall of the B√©r√©govoy government in 1993. Macron's current prime minister is √âlisabeth Borne, the second female head of government in French history, whom he appointed upon the beginning of his second term to replace Castex in May 2022. Furthermore, Macron reshuffled his current cabinet twice since its formation: first in July 2022, second in July 2023.\n\nDuring his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to labour laws, taxation and pensions; he has pursued a renewable energy transition. Dubbed 'president of the rich' by political opponents, increasing protests against his domestic reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency, culminating in 2018‚Äì2020 with the yellow vests protests and the pension reform strike. From 2020, he led France's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination rollout. In 2023, the government of his prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, passed legislation raising the retirement age from 62 to 64; the pension reforms proved controversial and led to public sector strikes and violent protests. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the European Union (EU) and signed bilateral treaties with Italy and Germany. Macron conducted $45-billion trade and business agreements with China during the China‚ÄìUnited States trade war and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over the AUKUS security pact. He continued Op√©ration Chammal in the war against the Islamic State and joined in the international condemnation of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n", imageName: "emmanuel_macron", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 48.870364,  longitude: 2.316758)),

    Leader(name: "Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan", age: 69, DOB: "29/02/1954", country: "Turkey", position: "President", flag: "üáπüá∑", description: "Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan is a Turkish politician serving as the 12th and current president of Turkey since 2014. He previously served as prime minister of Turkey from 2003 to 2014 and as mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He also co-founded the Justice and Development Party in 2001.\n\nBorn in G√ºneysu, Rize, Erdoƒüan moved with his family to Istanbul at the age of 13. He studied business administration at the Aksaray Academy of Economic and Commercial Sciences, before working as a consultant and senior manager in the private sector. During this time, Erdoƒüan became active in parties led by veteran Islamist politician Necmettin Erbakan, starting as his party's Beyoƒülu district chair in 1984 and Istanbul chair in 1985. Following the 1994 local elections, Erdoƒüan was elected mayor of Istanbul, where he implemented a series of reforms that modernized the city's infrastructure and economy. In 1998 he was convicted for inciting religious hatred and banned from politics after reciting a poem by Ziya G√∂kalp that compared mosques to barracks and the faithful to an army. Erdoƒüan was released from prison in 1999 and subsequently abandoned openly Islamist politics, breaking with Erbakan to form the AKP, a party designed to follow the example of the European Christian democratic parties.\n\nErdoƒüan led the AKP to a landslide victory in the election for the Grand National Assembly in 2002, only a year after founding the party. After his political ban was lifted by prime minister Abdullah G√ºl, Erdoƒüan became prime minister after winning a by-election in Siirt in 2003. Erdoƒüan led the AKP to two more election victories in 2007 and 2011. Reforms made in the early years of Erdoƒüan's tenure as prime minister granted Turkey the start of EU membership negotiations. Furthermore, Turkey experienced an economic recovery from the economic crisis of 2001 and saw investments in infrastructure including roads, airports, and a high-speed train network. He also won two successful constitutional referendums in 2007 and 2010. Erdoƒüan reduced the military influence on politics, withstood the criticism of the armed forces' e-memorandum documents and remained controversial for his close links with the G√ºlen movement, with whom the AKP was accused of orchestrating purges against military officers through the Balyoz and Ergenekon trials. In late 2012, his government began peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to end the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict, which ended three years later.\n\nIn 2014, Erdoƒüan became the nation's first popularly elected president. Erdoƒüan's presidency has been marked by democratic backsliding and a shift towards a more authoritarian style of government and has faced allegations of human rights abuses, suppression of dissents and suppression of freedom of speech. He has been criticized for his handling of several issues, including the 2013 Gezi Park protests, the 2016 failed coup attempt, his economic policies and the ongoing conflict in Syria, which is believed to have contributed to the bad results of the 2019 local elections, in which his party lost power in large cities to opposition parties for the first time in 15 years. Erdoƒüan supported the 2017 referendum, changing Turkey's parliamentary system into a presidential system, introducing term limit for the head of government (two full five-year terms), and greatly expanding executive powers. This new system of government formally came into place after the 2018 general election, where Erdoƒüan became an executive president. His party however lost the majority in the parliament since then and is currently in a coalition (People's Alliance) with the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Especially starting from 2018, he has decreased the independence of the Central Bank and pursued a highly unorthodox monetary policy, leading to high inflation rates and the depreciation of the value of the Turkish lira. From 2020, he led Turkey's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination rollout.

A member of the House of Representatives, he previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2012 to 2017 and as acting Minister of Defense in 2017.\n\nBorn into a political family, Kishida spent part of his childhood in the United States, where he attended elementary school in New York City. After beginning his career in finance, Kishida entered politics and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993 as a member of the LDP. Kishida was appointed to various posts in the cabinets of prime ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda from 2007 to 2008, and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2012 after Abe regained the premiership following the 2012 general election, serving for five years and becoming the longest-serving Foreign Affairs Minister in Japanese history. Kishida resigned from the Abe cabinet in 2017 in order to head the LDP's Policy Research Council. Kishida also assumed control of the LDP's more moderate K≈çchikai faction in 2012 following the retirement of faction boss Makoto Koga.\n\nLong considered a potential future prime minister, Kishida ran in the 2020 LDP leadership election, but lost to Yoshihide Suga. He ran again for the party leadership in 2021, this time winning in a second round run-off against opponent Taro Kono. Kishida was confirmed as Prime Minister by the National Diet four days later on 4 October 2021. He led the LDP to victory in the 2021 general election later that same month, albeit at a substantially reduced majority.\n\nKishida has been described as a moderate conservative and has stated that his premiership will focus on a 'new model of capitalism', by seeking to implement redistributive policies to expand the middle class. On foreign policy he has continued strengthening the Quad Security Dialogue in pursuit of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, taken steps to repair ties with South Korea and in 2022 instructed the cabinet to increase Japan's military budget by 65% by 2027. His premiership has seen political scandals related to the LDP's links to the Unification Church which came to public attention after the assassination of Shinzo Abe in 2022.\n\n", imageName: "fumio_kishida", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 35.673019,  longitude: 139.742422)),

After recovering from a severe illness of pneumonia and cysts, he was inspired to join the Jesuits in 1958. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was the Jesuit provincial superior in Argentina. He became the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and was created a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. He led the Argentine Church during the December 2001 riots in Argentina. The administrations of N√©stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner considered him to be a political rival. Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, a papal conclave elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi.\n\n Throughout his public life, Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor, and commitment to interreligious dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse rather than in the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace used by previous popes.\n\n", imageName: "pope-francis", locationCoordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 37.586673,  longitude: 126.976268))
